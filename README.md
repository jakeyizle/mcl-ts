## Overview

This is a `Vite`-integrated `Electron` template built with simplification in mind.

The repo contains only the most basic files, dependencies and functionalities to ensure flexibility for various scenarios.

You need a basic understanding of `Electron` and `Vite` to get started. But that's not mandatory - you can learn almost all the details by reading through the source code. Trust me, this repo is not that complex. ðŸ˜‹

## Quick start

```sh
npm create electron-vite
```

## Debug

## Directory structure

Once `dev` or `build` npm-script is executed, the `dist` folder will be generated. It has the same structure as the project, the purpose of this design is to ensure the correct path calculation.

```tree
â”œâ”€â”€ electron                  Electron-related code
|   â”œâ”€â”€ main                  Main-process source code
|   â”œâ”€â”€ preload               Preload-script source code
|   â””â”€â”€ resources             Resources for the production build
|       â”œâ”€â”€ icon.icns             Icon for the application on macOS
|       â”œâ”€â”€ icon.ico              Icon for the application
|       â”œâ”€â”€ installerIcon.ico     Icon for the application installer
|       â””â”€â”€ uninstallerIcon.ico   Icon for the application uninstaller
|
â”œâ”€â”€ release                   Generated after production build, contains executables
|   â””â”€â”€{version}
|       â”œâ”€â”€ {os}-unpacked     Contains unpacked application executable
|       â””â”€â”€ Setup.{ext}       Installer for the application
|
â”œâ”€â”€ public                    Static assets
â””â”€â”€ src                       Renderer source code, your React application
```

## Use Electron and NodeJS API

> ðŸš§ By default, Electron doesn't support the use of API related to Electron and NodeJS in the Renderer process, but someone might need to use it. If so, you can see the template ðŸ‘‰ **[electron-vite-boilerplate](https://github.com/electron-vite/electron-vite-boilerplate)**

#### Invoke Electron and NodeJS API in `Preload-script`

- **electron/preload/index.ts**

  ```typescript
  import fs from "fs";
  import { contextBridge, ipcRenderer } from "electron";

  // --------- Expose some API to Renderer-process. ---------
  contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld("fs", fs);
  contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld("ipcRenderer", ipcRenderer);
  ```

- **electron/renderer/src/global.d.ts**

  ```typescript
  // Defined in the window
  interface Window {
    fs: typeof import("fs");
    ipcRenderer: import("electron").IpcRenderer;
  }
  ```

- **electron/renderer/src/main.ts**

  ```typescript
  // Use Electron and NodeJS API in the Renderer-process
  console.log("fs", window.fs);
  console.log("ipcRenderer", window.ipcRenderer);
  ```

## Use SerialPort, SQLite3, or other node-native addons in the Main-process

- First, you need to make sure that the dependencies in the `package.json` are NOT in the "devDependencies". Because the project will need them after packaged.

- Main-process, Preload-script are also built with Vite, and they're built as [build.lib](https://vitejs.dev/config/#build-lib).  
  So they just need to configure Rollup.

```js
export default {
  build: {
    // built lib for Main-process, Preload-script
    lib: {
      entry: "index.ts",
      formats: ["cjs"],
      fileName: () => "[name].js",
    },
    rollupOptions: {
      // configuration here
      external: ["serialport", "sqlite3"],
    },
  },
};
```

## `dependencies` vs `devDependencies`

- First, you need to know if your dependencies are needed after the application is packaged.

- Like [serialport](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serialport), [sqlite3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlite3) they are node-native modules and should be placed in `dependencies`. In addition, Vite will not build them, but treat them as external modules.

- Dependencies like [Vue](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue) and [React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react), which are pure javascript modules that can be built with Vite, can be placed in `devDependencies`. This reduces the size of the application.
